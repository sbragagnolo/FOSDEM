#Title: 
Analysing and Evolving software projects.


#Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics):

Which engineer does not arrive on a new software project to add new features, migrate the system, or…? Generally, documentation, when it exists is no more up to date, original developers are no more in the place or knowledge of the business is only spread into the software. 
Software models the world and the world is changing (new laws, new markets, new technologies…), so software evolution in ineluctable. Key software assets (bank, transport, aircraft control, industrial robots, etc) have an average lifetime of 25 years. Such applications are crucial to our economy and must continuously evolve to adapt to the world changing. Same problems occur for open source projects. For example Apache will blow it 25th candles in 2020 after knowing a lot of modifications in its code.

Understanding such applications and ensuring that they can evolve is a challenge for which some results have emerged over the years.  Since the beginning of 1990, reports show that maintenance and evolution cost up to 90% of a project. Evolving such larger and larger software systems is a huge cost for any companies, or open source communities that take it as a normal pain. This pain is not ineluctable. Solutions exist.

The aim of this dev room is to gather developers around tools, approaches and methodologies to analyse and evolve software systems. 

By the way, open source communities may take advantage of these tools since it could reduce the entry fees to participate in the projects. Developing analysing and evolving tools may help to increase the developer number of the open source projects.


#Why does it fit FOSDEM?:

Understanding Open source projects: Open source projects have specific development rules since lot of developers participate in the development. They are spread around the world. Development etiquettes are often less strict than on closed projects. 
How open source projects can take benefit on tools to analyse and make them evolve.

The integrator has to know the impact of the change to integrate on the whole project before accepting it.
