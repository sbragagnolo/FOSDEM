# Title: 
Tools for Analysing and Evolving Software Projects


# Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics):
Software models the world and the world is changing (new laws, new markets, new technologies…), so software evolution is unavoidable. Key software assets (bank, transport, aircraft control, industrial robots, etc) have an average lifetime of 25 years. Such applications are crucial to our economy and must continuously evolve to adapt to the world changing. Same problems occur for open-source projects. For example Apache will blow it 25th candles in 2020 after knowing a lot of modifications in its code.
Which engineer does not arrive on a new software project to add new features, migrate the system, or…? Generally, documentation, when it exists is no more up to date, original developers are no more in the place or knowledge of the business is only spread into the software. 

Understanding such applications and ensuring that they can evolve is a challenge for which some results have emerged over the years.  Since the beginning of 1990, reports show that maintenance and evolution cost up to 90% of a project. Evolving such larger and larger software systems is a huge cost for any companies, or open-source communities that take it as a normal pain. This pain is not ineluctable. Solutions exist.

The aim of this dev room is to gather developers of software analysis tools, approaches and methodologies to evolve software systems. This covers: code metrics, quality model, program visualisation, rule checking, recommanders, refactorings, architecture extraction and validation, commit analysis, ...

Open-source communities take advantage of these tools since it can reduce the entry fees to participate in the projects. 
Developing analysing and evolving tools help increasing the developer number of the open-source projects.


# Why does it fit FOSDEM?:

There are many mature open-source tools and environments that support software analyses (Metrics, software visualisation, code refactorings, architectural extraction,...).
This is important to have a forum so that tool builders can exchange, confront their solutions, and foster new ideas around this key field that touches every successful software systems.

In addition, other open-source projects can take advantage of the existence of solid software analysis tools at different levels:
program understanding, rule checking, quality models, refactorings, domain specific refactorings, commit analysis,...
